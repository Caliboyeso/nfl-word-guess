# Summary
NFL Word Guess is a hangman game with the NFL as the theme where the user gets 10 guesses per round. The hidden word will be hidden behind underscores and replaced with the correct letter the user guesses correctly. I used the inquirer package to be able to grab the user input, and the chalk package to add color to the text in the console.
