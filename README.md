# Summary
NFL Word Guess is a word guess game with the NFL as the theme where the user gets 10 guesses per round. The hidden word will be hidden behind underscores and replaced with the correct letter the user guesses. I used the inquirer package to be able to grab the user input, and also the chalk package so color can be added to the text in the console.
